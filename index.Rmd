## Introduction

This application predicts the risk of developing Oesophageal cancer amongst smokers and alcoholics. The application predicts the cancer risk using the features such as the subject's Age group, Daily alcohol consumption and Daily tobacco consumption.

This application uses data from a case-control study of (o)esophageal cancer in Ille-et-Vilaine, France. This data named 'esoph' is available in the R datasets package.
``` {r }
summary(esoph)
```
